# ASIC-Design-Flow-for-a-Vending-Machine-Controller
This repository contains the complete RTL-to-GDSII design flow for a simple Vending Machine Controller. The project's primary goal is to demonstrate a fully open-source ASIC design methodology using tools like Icarus Verilog, Yosys, and the OpenROAD Project, targeting the SkyWater 130nm open-source PDK.
